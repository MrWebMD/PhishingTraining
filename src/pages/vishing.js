                  Christopher began his phishing awareness program for one of
                  his clients by sending phishing emails to all the client's
                  employees. This amounted to over 1000 emails being sent out
                  claiming to be a company sponsored iPhone giveaway.

                  "From this e-mail alone, Chris got 750 people to click the

                  As stunning as this is, this wasn't the end. Part of
                  Christopher's goal in this engagement was to get access to the
                  clients internal network. This means that Christopher must get
                  remote access to a computer connected to the companies
                  network.

                  Christopher called the employees claiming to be someone within
                  their IT department. This allowed him to leverage this
                  position of trust to install malware. The employees could have
                  verified they were speaking with the right person by
                  referencing their internal directory containing accurate
                  contact information. If you ever receive an urgent call from a
                  company you trust, it is safer to hang up the call and then
                  call the phone number listed on their website yourself.
                </p>

                <li>Don't install unknown software.</li>
                <p>
                  The victim of this phone call was told to install a "PC
                  cleaning" software from ftp://update-****.com . This url is
                  not associated with their company website in any way. After
                  opening this in their browser, they are greeted with an
                  executable file to download and run. This should be a dead
                  giveaway. Never download software from untrusted sources,
                  especially not over the phone, through email, text messages,
                  or similar. In most cases, usually those responsible for
                  certain technology at a company have the means of performing
                  these maintenance related tasks remotely.
